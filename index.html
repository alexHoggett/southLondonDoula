          <h3 class="sub-heading">About Me</h3>
          <p>I’m Robyn, I use both she/they pronouns. I am a breastfeeding counsellor & doula based in southwest London. I am a dedicated mama to one lovely person. I became a doula because of what I learnt through my own pregnancies and I’m passionate about offering empathic support to people in all areas of life, especially when it comes to pregnancy, birth, feeding and early mothering~parenting. While building up this trust in our bodies, I also work to ensure you are aware of your choices and have the confidence to explore your unique power and rhythm.</p>

      <h3 class="sub-heading">FAQ's</h3>

        <h4 class="faq__heading">What does a doula actually do?</h4>
        <p class="faq__answer">A doula \DOO-luh\ is a Greek word meaning‘ highest woman servant during birth’ – we use it in childbirth to refer to the role of a supportive person who actively supports a woman, birthing person and their family through pregnancy, birth and early parenthood. A doula aims to adapt their care to each individual birthing person depending on their specific needs and desires for birth. A doula does not perform or offer clinical tasks but works closely with midwives to give you the best care during pregnancy and birth. The role of the doula is to ‘be’ and not very much to ‘do’. I work to support your choices and ensure you have access to evidence-based information so you are aware of your options and able to make informed choices. I empower you to trust your body, the process of birth and to build positive relationships with your health care providers.</p>

       <h4 class="faq__heading">What are the next steps if i want to work with you?</h4>
       <p class="faq__answer">We can have a virtual consultation to get to know each other, talk about my services, and determine if weight is a good fit for one another. There is no fee and no obligation to book with me after. Once we have talked I’ll send more information to you and my service agreement documents, you’ll then have time to decide and confirm if you would like us to work together. Once the service agreement is signed and the deposit paid I am booked for you!</p>
