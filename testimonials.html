          <p class="testimonial__quote  quote">Robyn is nothing short of fantastic - she helped me in the first 4 weeks of motherhood and I can honestly say I would not be the mum I am now if not for her! Her knowledge of all things baby is vast, including breastfeeding and baby wearing, and she's able to impart in a very unobtrusive way - empowering you to make your own decisions and have a far better understanding of your baby.</p>

          <p class="testimonial__quote  quote">As a partner, I found Robyn to be an exceptional doula. She was engaging, friendly, intuitive and supportive. Despite the uncertainty caused by the pandemic Robyn provided a calming and stable presence which enabled my partner and I to remain equally calm. I don’t think Robyn proffered advice throughout the pregnancy but instead listened, asked thoughtful and considered questions and then supported us with any decision that we made.
          Our birth process did not go as we had first envisaged. However, with Robyn’s support, and the techniques that she enabled us to develop, my partner and I could see the birthing process in a far more positive way than we may have otherwise. I don’t know if one recommends a doula, or if it’s appropriate as it depends on you and what you are looking for. But from our experience, it was wonderful having Robyn by our side and on our side.</p>

          <p class="testimonial__quote  quote">When I first met with Robyn I felt able to share my personal circumstances with her completely, which (as a single mama) helped me feel able to have her completely as part of my journey. Before the birth we had time to go through my birthing preferences and complete a visual birth plan. This was a very comprehensive process and no question was too simple for her. This made me feel informed, confident and comfortable - much more so than I did with any statutory support. In labour Robyn was on hand and her usual calm and knowledgeable self. I'll alway remember a moment of advocacy in the labour where she reinforced my wishes while I was labouring - something I could hear but not fully focus on or appreciate at the time. Even though my sister was also present, it was so helpful hearing them discuss my wishes and wait for my input when I felt the energy to be able. At no point were any decisions made without me and it feels like that could have been different without her. During labour and after, Robyn was a hugely useful source of information but also a caring listening ear. She helped me with our first bath for bubba and even shared her wisdown when having some feeding issues some time down the line. I always felt listened to, supported and always in control and having Robyn there through a long pregnancy and a long and little bit challenging labour was incredibly reassuring, positive and healthy! I would highly recommend Robyn to anyone that's unsure about having a Doula and sending love and wellness your way!</p>

          <p class="testimonial__quote  quote">Robyn was a great support during the last weeks of my pregnancy, she talked to me and my partner about the choices we had, but most important was her determination to focus on what we wanted and how we wanted the birth to be. She guided me to write a birth plan that was changing as the birth was approaching due to my personal circumstances. At the end I had an elected C-session and Robyn was there to help me write my birth plan for the C- session that included lowering the screen and seeing the baby coming,  immediately skin to skin contact and a delayed umbilical cord clamping. I have to thank Robyn for her support that made that unforgettable moment happier and fulfilling.</p>
